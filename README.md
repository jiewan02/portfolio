## 🚀 About The Project
This is my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my work as an **Aspiring AI Engineer & Full Stack Developer**. 

It serves as a central hub for my projects, ranging from **LLM & Computer Vision research** to **Full-Stack Web Applications**. The site is built with React to demonstrate modern frontend development skills and is hosted directly on GitHub Pages.

**Live Demo:** [https://jiewan02.github.io/portfolio](https://jiewan02.github.io/portfolio)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Framework:** [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* **Styling:** CSS3 (Custom responsive design)
* **Deployment:** GitHub Pages (`gh-pages`)
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## ✨ Key Features
* **Responsive Hero Layout:** A split-screen design that adapts seamlessly to mobile and desktop screens.
* **Dynamic Project Grid:** A scalable card system that renders project data (titles, tech stacks, links) from a structured JSON array.
* **Direct Asset Integration:** Hosts and serves static assets (PDF resumes, slide decks, images) directly from the repository.
* **Professional Branding:** Clean typography and visual hierarchy tailored for technical recruiters.
